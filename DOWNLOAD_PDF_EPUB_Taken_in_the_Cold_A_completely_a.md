Overview
&quot;Make sure you wrap up warm for school, honey. A blizzard is on the way.&quot; Ten-year-old Teddy rolls his eyes at his mother. But then he hears a bang... By the time police arrive, Teddy&#039;s mother is dead. His open school backpack is strewn across the hallway. And Teddy is nowhere to be found. When gunshots ring out from an exclusive family home on the edge of Northern Pine Lake, Agent Tori Hunter races through the gathering snowstorm to discover that ten-year-old Teddy Marist has disappeared. His mother and her new boyfriend are dead in the family kitchen, breakfast still cooking on the stove. And racing to track down Teddy&#039;s father, Tori finds he is missing too. Local police are certain this is a simple case of a jealous ex-husband turned violent over his recent divorce. But interviewing everyone she can about Teddy&#039;s father, Tori&#039;s gut has her questioning if he would really kidnap his own child? And when Teddy&#039;s father is found dead in a pool of blood at an abandoned vacation resort, Tori is devastated to be proven right. Just as she&#039;s desperately following a set of tire tracks leading away from the crime scene Tori gets a chilling phone call: Teddy is safe. But not for long. Meet me-alone. No guns. No backup. Surrounded by the driving blizzard and the biggest storm Manchester Bay has seen for decades, Tori is determined to go it alone. But she knows the phone call means this case is about more than one lost little boy... and that a deadly, decades-old secret about the history of the abandoned resort could threaten the whole community. With Teddy&#039;s life-and the lives of those she loves-hanging in the balance, can Tori track down the kidnappers before it&#039;s too late? A totally addictive thriller that will have you racing through the pages, unable to put it down until you know the truth. Perfect for fans of Mary Stone, Charlie Donlea and Kendra Elliot.
