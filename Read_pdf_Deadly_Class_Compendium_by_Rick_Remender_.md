Overview
From New York Times-bestselling writer RICK REMENDER (LOW, BLACK SCIENCE) and fan favorite artist Wes Craig (KAYA, Batman) this compendium collects the entire dark, heartfelt, and twistedly humorous story of a group of damaged Gen X teens fighting a system determined to transform them into monsters.
 
 It&#039;s 1987. Marcus Lopez hates school. His grades suck. The jocks are hassling his friends. He can&#039;t focus on class. But the jocks are the children of Joseph Stalin&#039;s top assassin, the teachers are members of an ancient league of assassins, the class he&#039;s failing is &quot;Dismemberment 101,&quot; and his crush has a double-digit body count. Welcome to the most brutal high school on earth, where the world&#039;s top crime families send the next generation of assassins to be trained. Murder is an art. Killing is a craft. At Kings Dominion School for the Deadly Arts, the dagger in your back isn&#039;t always metaphorical.
