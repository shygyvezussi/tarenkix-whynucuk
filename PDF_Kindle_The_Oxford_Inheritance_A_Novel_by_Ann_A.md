At prestigious Oxford University, an American student searches for the truth about her motherâ€™s death in this eerie, suspenseful thriller that blends money, murder, and black magic. You canâ€™t keep it from her forever. She needs to know the truth. Cassandra Blackwell arrives in Oxford with one mission: to uncover the truth about her motherâ€™s dark past. Raised in America, with no idea that her mother had ever studied at the famed college, a mysterious package now sends her across the ocean, determined to unravel the secrets that her mother took to her grave. Plunged into the glamorous, secretive life of Raleigh College, Cassie finds a world like no other: a world of ancient tradition, privilegeâ€”and murder. Beneath the hallowed halls of this storied university there is a mysterious force at work . . . A dark society that is shaping our world, and will stop at nothing to keep its grip on power. Cassie might be the only one who can stop themâ€”but at what cost?
