An inspirational journal filled with rousing quotes from Presidential inaugural poet and activist Amanda Gormanâ€™s #1 New York Times bestsellers The Hill We Climb and Call Us What We Carry.
 
 For there is always light,
 If only weâ€™re brave enough to see it,
 If only weâ€™re brave enough to be it.
 
 Pulsing with hope and the fire to make change, Amanda Gormanâ€™s poetry is a call to action. Her poems insist on the pursuit of positive change, the power of a single voice, and the universality of the human experienceâ€”that we all must come back to each other to create a better future.
 
 As the youngest presidential inaugural poet, Gorman has established herself as a dynamic wordsmith with the power to inspire. Here for the first time is a journal that invites you to actively engage with her poetry. Flip from page to page to find over fifty quotes that challenge, uplift, and prompt dreams of a bright future, with an occasional poem reprinted in its entirety.
 
 With vibrant, graphic designs, this journal provides readers an opportunity to consider their own influence on their communities, their dreams for the future, and the plans for positive change that are available within all of us.
