Overview
This book represents a summation of a decade‚Äôs worth of therapy, research, workshops, and presentations around the unique aspects of social-emotional development in the neurodivergent community. The book grounds its approach in neuroscience and then applies those data to how our brains impact our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. As a child psychologist who specializes in working with this population, I pride myself on identifying the challenging aspects of having a different brain and empowering kids to manage those differences. As such, this book will contain sections that directly address the parts of being gifted that have traditionally been emphasized less: making friends, maintaining relationships, regulating emotions, communicating your feelings and needs appropriately, and being able to identify contextual factors to understand why people are acting the way they are. Naming the issues is one thing, but each section will contain case examples, clinical advice, and tangible skills that will help students grow in the areas of social-emotional learning (SEL). These skills are deliverable, generalizable, and appropriate for school, home, and the community. Most importantly, they work. I often say that I want my clients to have a little ‚Äúpocket Dr. Matt‚Äù to help them navigate the world; this book is my attempt at creating that kind of external support.
