From #1 New York Times Bestseller Vi Keeland, comes a new, sexy standalone novel.



 Terminated for inappropriate behavior.

 I couldnâ€™t believe the letter in my hands.

 Nine years. Nine damn years Iâ€™d worked my butt off for one of the largest companies in America, and I was fired with a form letter when I returned home from a week in Aruba.

 All because of a video taken when I was on vacation with my friendsâ€”a private video made on my private time. Or so I thoughtâ€¦

 Pissed off, I cracked open a bottle of wine and wrote my own letter to the gazillionaire CEO telling him what I thought of his company and its practices.

 I didnâ€™t think heâ€™d actually respond.

 I certainly never thought Iâ€™d suddenly become pen pals with the rich jerk.

 Eventually, he realized Iâ€™d been wronged and made sure I got my job back.

 Onlyâ€¦it wasnâ€™t the only thing Grant Lexington wanted to do for me.

 But there was no way I was getting involved with my bossâ€™s bossâ€™s boss. Even if he was ridiculously gorgeous, confident, and charming.

 It would be completely wrong, inappropriate even.

 Sort of like the video that got me into trouble to begin with.

 Two wrongs donâ€™t make a right.

 But sometimes itâ€™s twice as fun.
